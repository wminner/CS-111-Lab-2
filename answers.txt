Tasks Completed:
* osprd_process_request function
	read (-r)
	write (-w)
	deadlocks avoided
* osprd_ioctrl function
	acquire (-l)
	tryacquire (-L)
	release
* osprd_close_last function


TODO:
* N/A


Notes:
* Tests Passed: 1-18* (see known issues)
* Test 18 was added to test deadlocking (writer tries to lock twice)


Known Issues:
* Test case 6 is inconsistent on Wesley's computer, but consistently succeeds 
  on Christie's computer.  Sleep/delay timing seems to be not accurate enough 
  for sub-0.5-second timing on some hardware or emulation software 
  configurations.  See Piazza @247 for more info.
* Test cases 16 and 17 fail for an unknown reason on Wesley's computer using 
  virtual box, but succeed on Christie's computer consistently. By extending the
  2nd kill's sleep time, both cases will work consistently on Wesley's computer. 
  See Piazza @243 for more info.  Sleep/delay timing seems to be not accurate 
  enough for sub-0.5-second timing on some hardware or emulation software 
  configurations.
